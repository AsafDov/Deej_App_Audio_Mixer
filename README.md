# Deej - PC Volume Mixer
When I play games with friends, I like to keep spotify running with my music playing in the back ground, but I also want to talk with my friends on discord. 
Sometimes I like listening to music while watching Youtube videos as well, and sometimes I like music playing in the background during a teams work meeting. 
No matter the usecase, windows' mixer requires to many actions to operate, and inteferes with the current activity. For example, during a game I need to pause and move the focus to the desktop before being able to access the equlizer.
 
####I therefore present to you an arduino micro based solution that is a definite game changer for the convenience of multitasking
